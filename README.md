# ticTacToe
It's a version of tic tac toe that I created, in Java.
The game now has full logic capabilty and proper PvP elements. This includes checks for diagonal winds, column wins and row wins.

Note
===
Also, there will be 2 versions of the game to play, one PvP the other PvE.
I will add the PvE element later, but for now its just PvP.
^ this might take a while :p

Things to still do:
- Possible game commands i.e. Ask the player if they want to play again .etc
- Token customisation
- PvE system
